# Caesar Cipher APP

#### By **Elvis Makuthi, May 17, 2019**

## Description
This is a very simple encryption technique: it substitutes each letter with a different one based on a shift value. For example, applying a shift factor of 10 to Sinatra will turn it into Csxkdbk. A negative number can also be used instead; -10 would result in Iydqjhq.


## Behavior of the programm
